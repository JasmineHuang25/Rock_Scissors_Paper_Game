## Gaol and Purpose


## Dataset and EDA
#### First dataset:
Firstly, I used the dataset from Laurence Moroney - The AI Guy. it contains a total of 2892 images.
Test set: 372 images (214 each)
Train set: 2520 images (840 each)
Validation set: 33 images

#### Second dataset:

#### Third and final dataset:
I have created total 17550 real images of rock, scissors and paper, captured from webcam
Found 13500 images belonging to 3 classes.
Found 4350 images belonging to 3 classes.



## Models

### CNN: Convolutional Neural Network

### KNN: k-nearest neighbors

### KM: K-Means clustering

## Best Model: CNN


## Web App Deployment using Gradio

(Host it on Streamlit or Hugging Face!!)

## Limitations and Next Steps
Due to the computer power and some technical issues, here are steps I would like to take but can't execute at this moment:
1. Feed more data: More images. Also try images with background removed along with color inverted.
2. More models: Would like to try out other models such as VGG16 or VGG19.
3. Live professional web app: Would love to upgrade my demo web app to a professional one.
